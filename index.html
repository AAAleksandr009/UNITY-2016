<p>UNITY was an open source project created by Jamie Green in 2015.</p>

<p>It's goal was to provide users with a new desktop experience, in the form of Wallpapers, Themes, Icons, Skins and much more! UNITY 2015 turned out to be a huge success with many volunteer contributors helping shape the design of the Suite.</p>

<p>This year we hope for just as big or bigger turnout in respects to the project. With new and old contributors welcome to create a desktop environment that is revolutionary in concept and design. With prospects of it being open to Windows, Linux and OS X users alike. Maybe even contributions to the mobile world this year!</p>

<p>So we look forward in pushing UNITY 2016 out for everyone to enjoy in 2016!</p>

<p>Cheers, Jamie Green (founder)</p>

<p>----------Linux Users------------</p>

<p>There's no client for you unfortunately so you'll have to set things up via terminal. You should be used to that by now anyways. There are, however, instructions for you too! <a href="http://bit.ly/228VGyt">http://bit.ly/228VGyt</a></p>
