{"name":"Unity-2016","tagline":"UNITY 2016 SUITE!","body":"This is for the UNITY 2016 Suite!  All skinners and themers welcome.\r\nOpen to Windows, Linux & OS X users.\r\nThe project is open sourced, we have a chat channel for it on Slack.\r\nIf you want to come chat with us send me an email at JamieRobertGreen@gmail.com requesting an invite.\r\n\r\nIf you want a peek at the project here is a link...\r\nhttp://fav.me/d9k9vmb\r\n\r\nUNITY was an open source project created by Jamie Green in 2015.\r\n\r\nIt's goal was to provide users with a new desktop experience, in the form of Wallpapers, Themes, Icons, Skins and much more! UNITY 2015 turned out to be a huge success with many volunteer contributors helping shape the design of the Suite.\r\n\r\nThis year we hope for just as big or bigger turnout in respects to the project. With new and old contributors welcome to create a desktop environment that is revolutionary in concept and design. With prospects of it being open to Windows, Linux and OS X users alike. Maybe even contributions to the mobile world this year!\r\n\r\nSo we look forward in pushing UNITY 2016 out for everyone to enjoy in 2016!\r\n\r\nCheers, Jamie Green (founder)\r\n\r\n----------Contributors----------\r\n\r\nThere is a client for Windows and Mac.\r\nGet it here: http://bit.ly/1JEYZ6S\r\n\r\nThere are also instructions for setting up the client.\r\nhttp://bit.ly/1QqOzxP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------Linux Users------------\r\n\r\nThere's no client for you unfortunately so you'll have to set things up via terminal. You should be used to that by now anyways. There are, however, instructions for you too! http://bit.ly/228VGyt","google":"UA-71518764-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
