There is a client for Windows and Mac.
Get it here: http://bit.ly/1JEYZ6S

There are also instructions for setting up the client.

----Instructions for Client Users-----

So how do you use this client, why am I seeing just a blank screen. How do I add the repository? I'm assuming you already linked your github account to the client (if you didn't go to that link above about setting github up).

First you'll need to clone the repository locally so you can make changes to the repository (add folders, files, etc). To do that go to the "+" icon at the top left. Click on the "clone" tab. You should see a list of repositories associated with your account. Click on the one for UNITY-2016 and then select "clone" at the bottom of that list. It'll ask you where you want to store this repository. The github client will watch this folder for any changes (much like dropbox, onedrive, googledrive, etc).

Now you're probably wondering how do I make changes? I can't create my file in the client! Well you don't do it that way. You just don't. Anyways, you create your files or folders where the repository is stored on your computer locally. Then once you are done with your changes you need to submit them or rather "push" those changes to the cloud so everyone can seem them.

So to do this go to the "changes" tab at the top of the client. When you do you should see a list of your changes. Write a summary (title for commit) and a discription if you want to. Hit commit to master. Now what you need to do is sync which essentially pushes your changes to the cloud and gets any other changes someone else has committed since you last sync (pulled). Once you have done that you're all set!



----------Linux Users------------

There's no client for you unfortunately so you'll have to set things up via terminal. You should be used to that by now anyways. There are, however, instructions for you too! http://bit.ly/228VGyt
